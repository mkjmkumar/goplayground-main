# configtofunc

configtofunc was testing an idea I had to be able to configure different functions to be run.

## Use cases

- Non-technical users are responsible for maintaining the configuration. They are not familiar with golang or coding in
general, but would like to be able to run validation or utilities functions in the flow of execution. (ex. when passing
a string the user would like to check if it is a valid IPv4 address)
